# Ruby-PCB-Router
Topological Rubberband Autorouter for Printed Circuit Boards

This is an autorouter for Printed Circuit Boards using
a topological algorithm with rubberband traces. The code is
written in Ruby and not too difficult, the basic ideas of
this router are documented in the PHD thesis of Tal Dayan.

For pictures and some basic documentation you may visit my
hompage at http://ssalewski.de/Router.html.en

There you also can find a tar archive of the code including
some necessary Ruby glue code for CGAL and BOOST library.

The code works not bad already, but to make it really useful
some work is still needed.
